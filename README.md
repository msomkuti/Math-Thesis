## Applications of Linear Algebra in Facial Recognition

This repository contains the code and final document for my undergraduate thesis in Mathematics at Bates College in Lewiston Maine.

#### Note:
While I did finish my Thesis, I do not currently have access to my computer. The final code will be updated soon, but can be found temporarily in the pdf in the appendix.
